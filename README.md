# Questionnaire
This is a demo application which will help to make **Questionnaire** *(Survey, Feedback, Poll, Filter, Exam, Questions)* for users in your App.

This project got inspiration from this repo -> https://github.com/AndreiD/surveylib

![alt text](https://github.com/ShashiPrasadKushwaha/Questionnaire/raw/master/app/questionnaire.gif "Questionnaire Gif")
## Let see what you will learn from this Project.

 - How to use Room *(part of Android Architecture Components )*.
 - How to use simple Background process with RxJava *(RxAndroid)* or we say how to replace Async task with RxJava.
 - Parcelable with Nested Model (as List of Model inside Model) in Pojo.
 - Other various logic building.

#### Situations: (When its helpful to use/refer this Project)

 - [x] This project **only** works with situations where You have Multiple/Single Choice(s) based questions.**(If more variation needed, refer [AndreiD's work](https://github.com/AndreiD/surveylib))**

 - [x] If you want persistence with the previous selection of choice(s), means user can go back and modify the selection and previous selections will not lose there state.**(This is addition feature in this Project)**
 - [x] What if you don't want or submit the result of *Questionnaire* as soon the completion. Means if there is other work(s) before sending the survey to back-end, and also you don't want to hanging with result in between Activities. See the [AnswerActivity](https://github.com/ShashiPrasadKushwaha/Questionnaire/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/spk/questionnaire/questions/AnswersActivity.java) , how to retrieve the result from database and display/send. **(This is addition feature in this Project)**

###### Want to send result in Json format see the [AnswerActivity.java](https://github.com/ShashiPrasadKushwaha/Questionnaire/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/spk/questionnaire/questions/AnswersActivity.java)
```java
/*Here,JSON got created and send to make Result View as per Project requirement.
* Alternatively, in your case, you make Network-call to send the result to back-end.*/
private void makeJsonDataToMakeResultView()
{
  try
  {
     JSONArray questionAndAnswerArray = new JSONArray();
     int questionsSize = questionsList.size();
     if (questionsSize > 0)
	  {
		  for (int i = 0; i < questionsSize; i++)
		  {
             JSONObject questionName = new JSONObject();
             questionName.put("question",questionsList.get(i).getQuestion());
            //questionName.put("question_id",String.valueOf(questionsList.get(i).getQuestionId()));
             String questionId = String.valueOf(questionsList.get(i).getQuestionId());

            JSONArray answerChoicesList = new JSONArray();
            int selectedChoicesSize = questionsWithAllChoicesList.size();

            for (int k = 0; k < selectedChoicesSize; k++)
             {
                String questionIdOfChoice = questionsWithAllChoicesList.get(k).getQuestionId();
                if (questionId.equals(questionIdOfChoice))
                 {
                     JSONObject selectedChoice = new JSONObject();
                     selectedChoice.put("answer_choice", questionsWithAllChoicesList.get(k).getAnswerChoice());
                    //selectedChoice.put("answer_id", questionsWithAllChoicesList.get(k).getAnswerChoiceId());
                     answerChoicesList.put(selectedChoice);
                 }
             }

            questionName.put("selected_answer", answerChoicesList);

            questionAndAnswerArray.put(questionName);
          }
      }
		  questionsAnswerView(questionAndAnswerArray);

  } catch (JSONException e)
	 {
		  e.printStackTrace();
	 }
}
